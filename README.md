# MLOps Project 1 – End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project is part of my **DevOps → MLOps / AI Infrastructure** transition training.

The goal of this project is to build a **production-style ML pipeline**, including:

### 🔹 What This Project Will Include
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Model training in Python  
- Experiment tracking using **MLflow**  
- Model packaging using **FastAPI**  
- Containerization with **Docker**  
- Deployment to **AWS**  
- Basic monitoring & logging  

### 🔹 What I Will Learn
- How real ML systems are built and deployed  
- How to track experiments and model versions  
- How to package ML models into APIs  
- How to deploy ML services with cloud infrastructure  
- How to monitor ML models in production  

### 📚 Current Status
**Planning stage — training in progress.**  
Implementation will begin during **Week 1** of the Ultra-Fast MLOps Training Plan.

### 🔧 Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Python**
- **MLflow**
- **FastAPI**
- **Docker**
- **AWS (ECS/EKS/Lambda)**
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
